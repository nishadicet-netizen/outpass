The School Management System (Outpass Project) is a web-based platform designed to automate and simplify the daily operations of educational institutions. It manages student and staff data, attendance records, class schedules, and online outpass requests through a secure, role-based interface for administrators, teachers, and students. The system reduces paperwork, enhances communication, and improves overall efficiency by providing an organized and digital way to handle academic and administrative activities.
